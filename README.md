# Crabada loot clicker

## What?
This is a browser extension that clicks through the Crabada idle game to find a mine to loot. Then, the user has to complete a Captcha and send the loot transaction.

## How?
### Requirements:
* Clone this repository somewhere
* For Firefox users: replace the root `manifest.json` by the firefox one `(firefox_manifest/manifest.json)`
* Activate "Developer mode" here: `chrome://extensions`
* That will reveal the "Load unpacked" button, click it and search for the `crabadaClickBot` folder you cloned

You should now have the extension available on your browser. To use it, go to https://play.crabada.com/mine/start-looting and click the extension.
Choose the mines you wish to loot and click `Start`.
